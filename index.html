I am a software security researcher and entrepreneur. My research interest spans over the intersection of program analysis and cybersecurity. I leverage static analysis, dynamic analysis, symbolic execution, and formal verification to evaluate the security and safety of applications in emergent domains such as IoT and Android.

I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and was fortunate to work with [Prof. Somesh Jha](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jha/) and [Prof. Thomas Reps](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~reps/) on software debloating and Adversarial Machine Learning.

I completed my PhD in Computer Engineering at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, where I was fortunate to work with [Dr. Hamid Bagheri](https://cse.unl.edu/~hbagheri/) and [Dr. Qiben Yan](https://cse.msu.edu/~qyan/) and obtained MSc in Computer Security from the University of Kent. I received ACM SIGSOFT distinguished paper award and (ISC)2 graduate scholarship
