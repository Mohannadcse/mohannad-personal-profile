I am a software security researcher and entrepreneur. My research interests primarily revolve around the confluence of program analysis and cybersecurity. To assess the safety and security of applications in emerging fields such as Internet of Things (IoT) and Android, I utilize a mix of static and dynamic analysis, symbolic execution, and formal verification methods.

I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, a joint department of Chalmers University of Technology and the University of Gothenburg. Previously, I was a Research Associate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I had the privilege of working with [Prof. Somesh Jha](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jha/) and [Prof. Thomas Reps](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~reps/) on Software Debloating and Machine Learning Robustness.

I completed my PhD in Computer Engineering at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, where I was fortunate to work with [Dr. Hamid Bagheri](https://cse.unl.edu/~hbagheri/) and [Dr. Qiben Yan](https://cse.msu.edu/~qyan/) and obtained MSc in Computer Security from the University of Kent. I received ACM SIGSOFT distinguished paper award and (ISC)2 graduate scholarship"|markdownify}}
