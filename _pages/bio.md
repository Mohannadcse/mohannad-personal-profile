Mohannad Alhanahnah is a software security researcher and entrepreneur. He's a Co-founder and CTO at [FitStack](https://www.fitstack.dev/). FitStack is funded by [Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF)](https://www.warf.org/). Mohannad was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Madison working with [Prof. Somesh Jha](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jha/) and [Prof. Thomas Reps](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~reps/) on software debloating. Mohannad's research interests revolve around leveraging program analysis techniques for assessing and boosting application security. Mohannad completed his PhD in Computer Engineering at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln under the supervision of [Dr. Hamid Bagheri](https://cse.unl.edu/~hbagheri/) and [Dr. Qiben Yan](https://cse.msu.edu/~qyan/) and obtained MSc in Computer Security from the University of Kent. Mohannad worked as a researcher at iTrust lab at the Singapore University of Technology and Design and contributed to the development of Internet of Things Automatic Security Testbed. Mohannad worked also at Eindhoven University of Technology where he contributed to AU2EU. Mohannad received ACM SIGSOFT distinguished paper award and (ISC)2 graduate scholarship.
