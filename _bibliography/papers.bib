abstract = {The ubiquity of Internet of Things (IoT) and our growing reliance on IoT apps are leaving us more vulnerable to safety and security threats than ever before. Many of these threats are manifested at the interaction level, where undesired or malicious coordinations between apps and physical devices can lead to intricate safety and security issues. This paper presents IoTCOM, an approach to automatically discover such hidden and unsafe interaction threats in a compositional and scalable fashion. It is backed with auto-mated program analysis and formally rigorous violation detection engines. IoTCOM relies on program analysis to automatically infer the relevant app’s behavior. Leveraging a novel strategy to trim the extracted app’s behavior prior to translating them to analyzable formal specifications,IoTCOM mitigates the state explosion associated with formal analysis. Our experiments with numerous bundles of real-world IoT apps have corroborated IoTCOM’s ability to effectively detect a broad spectrum of interaction threats triggered through cyber and physical channels, many of which were previously unknown, and to significantly outperform the existing techniques in terms of scalability.},

abstract = {With the rapidly increasing number of cloud-based services, selecting a service provider is becoming more and more difficult. Among the many factors to be considered, trust in a given service and in a service provider is often critical. Appraisal of trust is a complex process, information about the offered service’s quality needs to be collected from a number of sources, while user requirements may place different emphasis on the various quality indicators. Several frameworks have been proposed to facilitate service provider selection, however, only very few of them are built on existing cloud standards, and adaptability to different contexts is still a challenge. This paper proposes a new trust framework, called Context-Aware Multifaceted Trust Framework (CAMFT), to assist in evaluating trust in cloud service providers. CAMTF is flexible and context aware: it considers trust factors, users and services. When making recommendations, CAMFT employs a combination of mathematical methods that depend on the type of trust factors, and it takes both service characteristics and user perspective into account. A case study is also presented to demonstrate CAMFT’s applicability to practical cases.}

    abstract = "{Security is considered a significant deficiency in cloud computing, and insider threats problem exacerbate security concerns in the cloud. In addition to that, cloud computing is very complex by itself, because it encompasses numerous technologies and concepts. Apparently, overcoming these challenges requires substantial efforts from information security researchers to develop powerful mitigation solutions for this emerging problem. This entails developing a taxonomy of insider threats in cloud environments encompassing all potential abnormal activities in the cloud and can be useful for conducting security assessment. This article describes the first phase of an ongoing research to develop a framework for mitigating insider threats in cloud computing environments. Primarily, it presents a multidimensional taxonomy of insider threats in cloud computing and demonstrates its viability. The taxonomy provides a fundamental understanding for this complicated problem by identifying five dimensions; it also supports security engineers in identifying hidden paths, thus determining proper countermeasures, and presents a guidance that covers all bounders of insiders’ threats issue in clouds; hence, it facilitates researchers’ endeavours in tackling this problem. For instance, according to the hierarchical taxonomy, clearly many significant issues exist in public cloud, while conventional insider mitigation solutions can be used in private clouds. Finally, the taxonomy assists in identifying future research directions in this emerging area.}",
